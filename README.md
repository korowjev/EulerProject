# EulerProject

I use this repository to keep track of the problems I solved from Euler project.

* The purpose of encoding the .jl files is only to prevent easy self-deceiving for those tempted to get an answer before trying. Obviously it can be easily decoded by brute force. But if you do that, my conscience is then clean, as you consciusly insisted in the easy way.

* Many of the answers end using the overview advice you get after finishing a problem. The purpose of the repository, besides keeping track, is to see how fast a problem can be solved in Julia Language.

If you don't know Euler project, you should :) https://projecteuler.net/
